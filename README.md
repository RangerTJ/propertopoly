# text-property-game
Text-based property game programmed in Python, for 2 to 30 players.
Players roll dice to travel around a circular game board with 25 spaces buying and renting property until there is only one player left with any money (the winner). When landing on, or passing the first space again, players are given their income for the lap. Prints a graphic history of player performance over the course of the game at the end.

Manual version prompts for a number of players and then manually prompts users for player input on decisions throughout the game. 
The simulated version automates decision-making and plays out a simulated 30 person game, where players buy property whenever they have the fiscal capacity to do so (random dice rolls for movements being the wildcard variable).

Thanks for playing!
