# Text-Based Property Game
This is a text-based property game programmed in Python 3.10, for 2 to 30 players (plays like a "Monopoly Lite").
Players roll dice to travel around a circular game board with 25 spaces buying and renting property until there is only one player left with any money (the winner). When landing on, or passing the first space again, players are given their income for the lap. Prints a graphic history of player performance over the course of the game at the end.

The manually-played version prompts for a number of players and then manually prompts users for player input on decisions throughout the game. 
The simulated version is fully automated and simulates a 30 person game. It assumes that players buy property whenever they have the fiscal capacity to do so (random dice rolls for movements being the wildcard variable in the simulation).

Thanks for playing!
